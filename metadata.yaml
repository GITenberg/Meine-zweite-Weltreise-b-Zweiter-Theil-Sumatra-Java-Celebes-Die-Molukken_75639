summary: '"Meine zweite Weltreise: Zweiter Theil: Sumatra, Java, Celebes, Die Molukken"
  by Ida Pfeiffer is a travelogue written in the mid-19th century. This narrative
  details the author''s explorations through the islands of Sumatra, Java, Celebes,
  and the Moluccas, providing insights into the cultures, landscapes, and experiences
  she encounters. Pfeiffer''s adventurous spirit drives her to venture into the unknown,
  often putting herself in risky situations to learn more about the indigenous peoples
  and their customs.  At the start of the journey, Pfeiffer eagerly prepares for her
  voyage to Sumatra, highlighting the challenges she anticipates, including the significant
  travel costs. Her arrival at Padang serves as the launch point for her exploration
  into the interior regions, where she plans to encounter the Battak people, notorious
  for their unique customs and cannibalistic history. Through her initial experiences,
  the reader is introduced to the lush landscapes and diverse cultures of Sumatra,
  as well as the various warnings she receives about the dangers that await her in
  the wild. As Pfeiffer sets off on horseback into the uncharted territories, she
  embodies the spirit of adventure, determined to document her findings despite the
  risks involved. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
